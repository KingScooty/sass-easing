sass-easing
===========

Some mixins for easing animations using SASS. 
I'll add to this file whenever i come across a cool easing pattern.

##Installation

`bower install sass-easing`

##Usage

Best to use alongside compass or bourbon (or an autoprefixer). An example useage can be seen as follows:

`@include transition(top 500ms $easeInCubic);`
